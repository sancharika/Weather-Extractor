RAG Weather Extractor ‚Äî Scrape, Clean, Embed, Retrieve, Parse


## üå¶Ô∏è RAG Weather Extractor

A Streamlit app that scrapes weather forecast pages, cleans and processes the data, embeds it in a vector database, and uses a cloud LLM (Groq) to extract structured weather information.

This app uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to convert messy webpage data into a neat JSON forecast table.

‚∏ª

Features
	‚Ä¢	Scrape any weather website using:
	‚Ä¢	Requests (fast and simple)
	‚Ä¢	Selenium (optional, for JavaScript-heavy pages)
	‚Ä¢	Clean HTML pages by removing ads, scripts, headers, footers, and other noise.
	‚Ä¢	Chunk the text into smaller sections for easier understanding by the AI model.
	‚Ä¢	Generate embeddings with HuggingFace embeddings and store them in Chroma vector database (in-memory).
	‚Ä¢	Use Groq LLM to extract weather forecasts in structured JSON.
	‚Ä¢	Show both the parsed JSON output and raw LLM output for debugging.
	‚Ä¢	Configurable chunk size, overlap, and max chunks for fine-tuning.
	‚Ä¢	In-memory storage by default; optionally, can be extended to persistent vector stores.

Forecast Schema

The extracted forecast JSON has the following structure (Pydantic schema):

[
  {
    "day": "Today",
    "max_temp": "31¬∞C",
    "min_temp": "23¬∞C",
    "condition": "Sunny",
    "humidity": "40%",
    "precipitation": "4%",
    "wind_speed": "NW 10 km/h",
    "wind_direction": "NW"
  }
]

Installation
	1.	Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/sancharika/Weather-Extractor.git
cd Weather-Extractor

	2.	Create a virtual environment

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

	3.	Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

Dependencies included:
	‚Ä¢	streamlit
	‚Ä¢	requests
	‚Ä¢	bs4 (BeautifulSoup)
	‚Ä¢	selenium (optional)
	‚Ä¢	selenium-stealth (optional)
	‚Ä¢	chromadb
	‚Ä¢	langchain
	‚Ä¢	langchain_groq
	‚Ä¢	pydantic
	‚Ä¢	huggingface-hub
	‚Ä¢	sentence-transformers

‚∏ª

Configuration
	‚Ä¢	Groq API Key: Required to run the LLM.
	‚Ä¢	Groq Model: Default: moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct-0905.
	‚Ä¢	Environment Variable Option (recommended for security):

export DEFAULT_GROQ_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

In Streamlit, you can set secrets under Settings ‚Üí Secrets:

DEFAULT_GROQ_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"


‚∏ª

Usage
	1.	Run the app locally:

streamlit run app.py

	2.	Input the following in the UI:

	‚Ä¢	Weather URL: The page to scrape (e.g., TimeAndDate extended forecast).
	‚Ä¢	Groq API Key: Your API key (or leave blank if using environment variable).
	‚Ä¢	Groq Model: Model name for Groq.
	‚Ä¢	Use Selenium: Optional checkbox if the website needs JavaScript rendering.
	‚Ä¢	Chunk size, overlap, max chunks: Optional advanced settings to fine-tune text splitting.

	3.	Click ‚ÄúExtract forecast (RAG)‚Äù.

	‚Ä¢	Parsed JSON forecast will appear.
	‚Ä¢	Raw LLM output is shown for debugging.

‚∏ª

How it Works
	1.	Scraping:
	‚Ä¢	Tries to fetch HTML via requests.
	‚Ä¢	Falls back to Selenium if enabled.
	2.	Cleaning HTML:
	‚Ä¢	Removes scripts, styles, nav, footer, ads, banners.
	3.	Chunking text:
	‚Ä¢	Breaks cleaned text into smaller pieces for embeddings.
	4.	Embeddings & VectorStore:
	‚Ä¢	Converts chunks into embeddings using HuggingFace.
	‚Ä¢	Stores embeddings in Chroma (in-memory).
	5.	RAG with Groq LLM:
	‚Ä¢	Retrieves relevant chunks from vector store.
	‚Ä¢	Sends them to Groq LLM with instructions to output strict JSON.
	6.	Display:
	‚Ä¢	Shows structured JSON forecast.
	‚Ä¢	Optionally shows raw LLM output for debugging.

‚∏ª

Notes
	‚Ä¢	Selenium requires chromedriver installed in PATH.
	‚Ä¢	The pipeline is in-memory by default; you can extend it to persistent storage.
	‚Ä¢	Works best for pages with text-based weather data. Pages that load content via heavy JavaScript may require Selenium.
	‚Ä¢	Groq API usage is rate-limited; make sure your key is valid.
